## NEXTJS

> Next.js is an open-source JavaScript framework that is built on top of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is primarily used for building web applications, and it is often described as a React framework for server-rendered or statically generated applications. Next.js provides a set of tools and conventions to streamline the development of React-based web applications, making it easier to build fast, performant, and scalable websites.

Provides additional features that enable you to build production-ready applications. These features include routing, optimized rendering, data fetching, bundling, compiling, and more.

You don’t need to install additional packages as Next.js provides everything you need. Opinions and conventions should be followed to implement these features.
  
[Read the documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)

## Why learn Next.js

Next.js simplifies the process of building a web application for production by providing features like:

1. Routing
2. API routes 
3. Rendering — client-side and server-side
4. Data fetching
5. Styling
6. Optimization — Images, forms, and scripts
7. Dev and Prod build system

## Some of the key features and concepts of Next.js include:
1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Next.js enables server-side rendering, which means that pages can be pre-rendered on the server and sent as fully formed HTML to the client, improving performance and SEO.
2. Static Site Generation (SSG): Next.js supports static site generation, allowing you to pre-render entire pages at build time. This results in extremely fast loading times and is great for content that doesn’t change frequently.
3. API Routes: You can create API endpoints within your Next.js application, allowing you to build both the frontend and backend within the same codebase.
4. Automatic Code Splitting: Next.js automatically splits your JavaScript code into smaller, optimized bundles. This improves performance by reducing the amount of code that needs to be loaded on the initial page load.
5. Image Optimization: It includes built-in support for optimizing and serving images efficiently, helping to improve performance and user experience.
6. File-based Routing: Routing is simple and intuitive in Next.js, as it follows a file-based approach. Creating files in the pages directory automatically generates routes for your application.

## Create first Next.js App
> To create a new Next.js project, you can use the following command, replacing project-name with the name of your project:


```javascript
 npx create-next-app@latest app-name
 ```

> The create-next-app command will prompt you to configure your project. You can choose whether to use TypeScript, ESLint, or Tailwind CSS. Follow the prompts and select the options that suit your project requirements.

``` javascript
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
 ```


> To start the development server and see your new Next.js application in action, run the following command.


```javascript
 npm run dev
 ```

## Routing

> Next.js introduced a new App Router built on React Server Components. It has a file-system-based routing mechanism. Files and folders in your codebase define URL paths the user can access in the browser. A special page.js file is used to make route segments publicly accessible.

<Image
  src="/blogs/routes.avif"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
  sizes="100vw"
  className="rounded"
/>

<Image
  src="/blogs/defining-routes.avif"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
  sizes="100vw"
  className="rounded"
/>


> In this example, the /dashboard/analytics URL path is not publicly accessible because it does not have a corresponding page.js file. This folder could be used to store components, stylesheets, images, or other colocated files.

```javascript
Good to know: .js, .jsx, or .tsx file extensions can be used for special files.
```


> Creating UI
Special file conventions are used to create UI for each route segment. The most common are pages to show UI unique to a route, and layouts to show UI that is shared across multiple routes.

> For example, to create your first page, add a page.js file inside the app directory and export a React component:


```javascript
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
}
```



## Data Fetching

1. Caching, and Revalidating
2. Server Actions and Mutations
3. Patterns and Best Practices


### Caching, and Revalidating

> Data fetching is a core part of any application. This page goes through how you can fetch, cache, and revalidate data in React and Next.js.

There are four ways you can fetch data:

1. On the server, with fetch
2. On the server, with third-party libraries
3. On the client, via a Route Handler
4. On the client, with third-party libraries.

Fetching Data on the Server with fetch : 
Next.js extends the native fetch Web API to allow you to configure the caching and revalidating behavior for each fetch request on the server. React extends fetch to automatically memoize fetch requests while rendering a React component tree.

You can use fetch with async/await in Server Components, in Route Handlers, and in Server Actions.

For example:


     ```javascript
      async function getData() {
        const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/...')
        // The return value is *not* serialized
        // You can return Date, Map, Set, etc.
      
        if (!res.ok) {
          // This will activate the closest `error.js` Error Boundary
          throw new Error('Failed to fetch data')
        }
      
        return res.json()
      }
      
      export default async function Page() {
        const data = await getData()
      
        return <main></main>
      }
```



```javascript
Good to know:
Next.js provides helpful functions you may need when fetching data in Server Components such as cookies and headers. These will cause the route to be dynamically rendered as they rely on request time information.
-In Route handlers, fetch requests are not memoized as Route Handlers are not part of the React component tree.
-In Server Actions, fetch requests are not cached (defaults cache: no-store).
-To use async/await in a Server Component with TypeScript, you'll need to use TypeScript 5.1.3 or higher and @types/react 18.2.8 or higher.

```



 Caching Data : 
Caching stores data so it doesn't need to be re-fetched from your data source on every request.

By default, Next.js automatically caches the returned values of fetch in the Data Cache on the server. This means that the data can be fetched at build time or request time, cached, and reused on each data request.


```javascript
// 'force-cache' is the default, and can be omitted
fetch('https://...', { cache: 'force-cache' })
```


However, there are exceptions, fetch requests are not cached when:

- Used inside a Server Action.
- Used inside a Route Handler that uses the POST method.



```

What is the Data Cache?
The Data Cache is a persistent HTTP cache. Depending on your platform, the cache can scale automatically and be shared across multiple regions.
Learn more about the Data Cache.

```





Revalidating Data : 
Revalidation is the process of purging the Data Cache and re-fetching the latest data. This is useful when your data changes and you want to ensure you show the latest information.

Cached data can be revalidated in two ways:

- Time-based revalidation: 
Automatically revalidate data after a certain amount of time has passed. This is useful for data that changes infrequently and freshness is not as critical.
- On-demand revalidation: 
Manually revalidate data based on an event (e.g. form submission). On-demand revalidation can use a tag-based or path-based approach to revalidate groups of data at once. This is useful when you want to ensure the latest data is shown as soon as possible (e.g. when content from your headless CMS is updated).



1. Time-based Revalidation :

To revalidate data at a timed interval, you can use the next.revalidate option of fetch to set the cache lifetime of a resource (in seconds).


```javascript
fetch('https://...', { next: { revalidate: 3600 } })
```

Alternatively, to revalidate all fetch requests in a route segment, you can use the Segment Config Options.


```javascript
export const revalidate = 3600 // revalidate at most every hour
```


If you have multiple fetch requests in a statically rendered route, and each has a different revalidation frequency. The lowest time will be used for all requests. For dynamically rendered routes, each fetch request will be revalidated independently.

Learn more about time-based revalidation.



2. On-demand Revalidation:

Data can be revalidated on-demand by path (revalidatePath) or by cache tag (revalidateTag) inside a Server Action or Route Handler.

Next.js has a cache tagging system for invalidating fetch requests across routes.

When using fetch, you have the option to tag cache entries with one or more tags.
Then, you can call revalidateTag to revalidate all entries associated with that tag.
For example, the following fetch request adds the cache tag collection:


```javascript
export default async function Page() {
  const res = await fetch('https://...', { next: { tags: ['collection'] } })
  const data = await res.json()
  // ...
}
```
