## NEXTJS

Next.js is an open-source JavaScript framework that is built on top of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is primarily used for building web applications, and it is often described as a React framework for server-rendered or statically generated applications. Next.js provides a set of tools and conventions to streamline the development of React-based web applications, making it easier to build fast, performant, and scalable websites.

Provides additional features that enable you to build production-ready applications. These features include routing, optimized rendering, data fetching, bundling, compiling, and more.

You don’t need to install additional packages as Next.js provides everything you need. Opinions and conventions should be followed to implement these features.

## Why learn Next.js

Next.js simplifies the process of building a web application for production by providing features like:

1. Routing
2. API routes 
3. Rendering — client-side and server-side
4. Data fetching
5. Styling
6. Optimization — Images, forms, and scripts
7. Dev and Prod build system


## Some of the key features and concepts of Next.js include:
1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Next.js enables server-side rendering, which means that pages can be pre-rendered on the server and sent as fully formed HTML to the client, improving performance and SEO.
2. Static Site Generation (SSG): Next.js supports static site generation, allowing you to pre-render entire pages at build time. This results in extremely fast loading times and is great for content that doesn’t change frequently.
3. API Routes: You can create API endpoints within your Next.js application, allowing you to build both the frontend and backend within the same codebase.
4. Automatic Code Splitting: Next.js automatically splits your JavaScript code into smaller, optimized bundles. This improves performance by reducing the amount of code that needs to be loaded on the initial page load.
5. Image Optimization: It includes built-in support for optimizing and serving images efficiently, helping to improve performance and user experience.
6. File-based Routing: Routing is simple and intuitive in Next.js, as it follows a file-based approach. Creating files in the pages directory automatically generates routes for your application.


## Create first Next.js App
To create a new Next.js project, you can use the following command, replacing <project-name> with the name of your project:

```
   npx create-next-app@latest <app-name>
```
