## NEXTJS

Next.js is an open-source JavaScript framework that is built on top of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is primarily used for building web applications, and it is often described as a React framework for server-rendered or statically generated applications. Next.js provides a set of tools and conventions to streamline the development of React-based web applications, making it easier to build fast, performant, and scalable websites.

Provides additional features that enable you to build production-ready applications. These features include routing, optimized rendering, data fetching, bundling, compiling, and more.

You don’t need to install additional packages as Next.js provides everything you need. Opinions and conventions should be followed to implement these features.
